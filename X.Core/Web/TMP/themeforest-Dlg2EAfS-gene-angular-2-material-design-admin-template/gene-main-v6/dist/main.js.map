I am feeling glad for what I have achieved here. But I think life is more about helping people rather than commanding them. I feel life is also full of variations in designs. In terms of design, nature creates beautiful graphs and sets lot of colors in our personal life.\\n                  </p>\\n                  <p class=\\\"mrgn-b-none\\\">\\n                     So yes I get ideas from nature. The way it designs hills, oceans and fills colors into them.
